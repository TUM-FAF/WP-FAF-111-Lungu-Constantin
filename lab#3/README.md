###Laboratory Work #3 README / Report

##About the application:

* The application consits of two drop-down pickers, one for color pick, another one for drawing mode. (E.g. - red and line mode)
* You have 4 modes of drawing - line, free, bezier curve and delete objects, and 5 colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue (I've chosen the rainbow colors that are available in the Foundation Framework).
* I've used only the Foundation Framework, I didn't use any third party library or any other provided library
* The eraser works with any kind of shape or rather mode that you've chosen
* There are two types of drawing, one of them is more real-time (you can see it in the screencast)
* Erasing a shape erases also every other shape or drawing behind it
* It is fun

## Completed objectives:

### Mandatory objectives:
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights
* Draw a Bezier curve
* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

### Objectives with points:
* Draw a custom bitmap image (1 pt)
* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects (2 pt)
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse (1 pt)
* Delete objects using mouse clicking (2 pt)
* Use mouse as an eraser of:
* a fixed width (1 pt)

## Conclusion
Drawing stuff is tough. I managed to do it without pushing and getting the current CG context from the main view, but it was harder this way. I've followed the same PSGs and a clean code style.
