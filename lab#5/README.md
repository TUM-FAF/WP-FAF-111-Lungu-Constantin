#Windows Programming, student gr. FAF-111 Lungu Constantin
###Laboratory Work #5 README / Report

##About the application:
* For this laboratory work, I've chosen to do a Code-Controlled Game.
* The game involves some basi knowledge on how to use *nix terminal commands, and simulates a MacOS engine which gives you tasks (currently is up to one task).
* I wanted the game to be social interactive, so in order to complete the first task you'll have to search for emails of students from FAF-111 (the task is to find out who copied your laboratory work #4 on windows programming using a provided test script).
* To use that script, as well, you'll have to ask someone for it's password, you can't use the script without the password. (it's just funny when somebody calls you and asks you what's the password for the script)
* The app (or the game) consists of a text view and a text field, for inputting commands. In the game using the 'help' command you'll get a list of all possible commands and how to use them.
* The game, basically, operates with strings so everything you see or type, create and so on, is not real, it's a string.
* I could do so that when you type in a command it appears on the output field of the window, but I just didn't want to, I wanted it working my way. It may be not such useful, but it's a thing that I kept in mind from the beginning so that's why I did it.
* New levels may be coming soon!

## Completed objectives:

### Mandatory objectives:
* Player should be controlled by programmable commands

## Conclusion
I always wanted to do this sort of an game (app) and to implement things like computer commands, but I never had the opportunity or a greater desire to do it. Implementing all this kind of operations and functions, like mkdir or cd, run and so on, was a lot of fun programming for me, even if it's basically operations with string, replacing, separating, removing, and others. This laboratory work was the hardest for me (not hardest, but took more time than the others), but I had a very nice time doing it.
