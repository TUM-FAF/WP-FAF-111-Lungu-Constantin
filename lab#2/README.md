###Laboratory Work #2 README / Report

##About the application:

* The application consists of a text field with the text "WP Laboratory #2", it's color and size can be changed by sliders present by it.
* The application has a button, which gives an alert on clicking.
* Inside the app is a table view, with 2 columns and infinite rows (it can be scrolled), and 2 buttons to work with it - add and remove. When pressing add, a new person is added to the list (Darth, R2-D2, Luke or Yoda), with respecting age in the second column.
* The app has 3 custom menu buttons available in the top header, one for hiding the app, another one for visiting my github repo, and another one for messing with the window's size, position and opacity.
* When pressing alt the background color changes from white to black
* I also implemented a Person class for the table view, because I needed the name and age identifiers inside a class so that I could give the table view a good data source.
* The application also has a secure text field, in which if you enter correctly my surname, it's giving an alert view that you're good. If not, it's saying that you don't know my surname.

## Completed objectives:

### Mandatory objectives:
* Display a dialogue box on some event
* Added custom system menus to the app
* Added a scroll bar (in my case, two sliders) that change the color and the size of the text
* Hooked up keyboard input

### Objectives with points:
* Added a listbox to which you can add and remove elements
* Customized the application by adding an icon (the image is in the repo)

## Conclusion
I've learned some new things in Cocoa programming by doing this laboratory work. Even if some things weren't as good as I wanted them to be I met the objectives, and made another OS X application by using XCode. As in the previous laboratory work, I've followed the same PSGs and the same code style.
