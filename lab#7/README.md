###Laboratory Work #7 README / Report

##About the application:
* The application consists of a simple view with five buttons - play, pause, stop, next, prev. Beside there are text labels for displaying the title of the current song that's playing, and the current time of the song.
* Also, the application contains sliders for changing the volume and for seeking the song (jumping around it, which is also useful for displaying the progress in such a method)
* Currently the songs are being played from the application's bundle (it coitains them) but it can be reprogrammed to play anything from the iTunes Media Library for example, but it will be a little harder because it's organized in an unuseful manner (in my opinion)

## Conclusion
As always doing OS X apps was a little harder because the layout and the classes are not the same as in iOS (mostly UI elements), but, taking in account that I've made an audio player for the iPhone last year (which was my course thesis), it was way more simple and straightforward than I imagined it to be. As usual, had fun doing apps.
